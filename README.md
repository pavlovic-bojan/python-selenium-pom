# python-selenium-pom

This repository is the result of my independent project to train certain things in E2E QA Automation.

I spent 2 days on the realization and setting up this project. JavaScript programming language was used to write the code.

The Web Site that I chose for testing is [practicetestautomation](https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/), and I had no intention of harming the company itself, but only to increase and improve my skills.

Side information: To use the application in a special environment the author accepts no responsibility if you cause damage to third parties
